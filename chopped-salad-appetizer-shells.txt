DIRECTIONS

1. Cook shells in plenty of boiling water, being careful not to overcook them.  Rinse in cold water, set aside.  Chop salad ingredients quite small because they must fit inside the shells.  Make dressing and pour over.  Toss slightly and add salt and pepper.  Stuff salad into cooked shells and refrigerate up to 4 hours.
