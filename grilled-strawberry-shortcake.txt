Grilled Strawberry Shortcake

INGREDIENTS

3 cups hulled and chopped ripe strawberries
3 Tbsp. sugar
2 Tbsp. orange juice or Grand Marnier
1 store bought angel food cake

DIRECTIONS

1. Oil the grill and heat to medium.  Place strawberries in a large foil plate and stir in sugar and liqueur.  Cover plate tightly with foil.  Slice angel food cake into wedges (about 8).
2. Place pie plate on grill.  Barbecue about 6 minutes and then push to side of grill.  Arrange cake slices on grill and barbecue uncovered until you see grill marks.  Strawberries should still be chunky but releasing enough juices to make a thin sauce.  
3. Spoon strawberry sauce over each wedge and add dollops of whipped cream and a sprig of mint.
