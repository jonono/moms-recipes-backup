Carbonara

INGREDIENTS

salt and freshly ground pepper
1 pound pasta, such as spaghetti
1/4 cup olive oil (enough to coat bottom of pan)
1/4 pound pancetta, chopped
1 tsp. red pepper flakes
5 to 6 cloves garlic, chopped
1/2 cup dry white wine
2 large egg yolks
freshly grated parmesan cheese
handful of finely chopped flat leaf parsley for garnish

DIRECTIONS

1. Boil a large saucepot of water and add liberal amount of salt and the pasta.  Cook abut 8 minutes, to al dente.
2. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over med heat.  Add olive oil and pancetta.  Brown 2 minutes and add red pepper flakes and garlic an cook another 2 to 3 minutes more.  Add wine and stir up all the pan drippings.  
3. In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks, then add 1 large ladleful (about 1/2 cup) of pasta cooking water.  This tempers the eggs and keeps them from scrambling when added to the pasta.
4. Drain pasta well and add it directly to the skillet with pancetta and oil.  Pour the egg mixture over the pasta.  Toss rapidly to coat the pasta without cooking the egg.  Remove pan from heat and add a big handful of cheese, lots of pepper and a little salt.  Continue to toss and turn the pasta until it soaks up the egg mixture and thickens, 1 to 2 minutes.  Garnish with parsley and add extra grated Romano.
