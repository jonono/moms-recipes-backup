INGREDIENTS

4 lb (1.8kg) pork ribs
1 1/3 cups beef broth
1 sweet onion, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 bay leaves
1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper

2 cups try whisky or bourbon
1/2 cup maple syrup
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
2 tbsp. soya sauce
1/4 tsp. pepper 
pinch of salt

DIRECTIONS

1. Remove membrane from underside of ribs.  Trim off excess fat and cut into 2 rib portions.
2. In slow cooker, add meat then cover with broth, onion, garlic, bay leaves, salt and pepper.  Cover and cook on LOW about 5 hours and no longer.  You do not want meat to fall off bones.  Transfer ribs to plate.  (You can make ahead and let cool, then refrigerate in airtight container for up to 12 hours).
3. For glaze, stir together ingredients over medium heat and boil gently, stirring occasionally until reduced and thickened at least 10 to 12 minutes.  
4. Place ribs on greased grill and grill over medium heat, turning and brushing with glaze until coated and sticky.
