World's Best Pasta Sauce

the best I've ever found

INGREDIENTS

1 pound sweet Italian sausage, sliced (I use Jonsonville's)
3/4 cup lean ground beef (I use a whole pound)
1/2 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes
2 - 6 oz cans tomato paste
2 - 6.5 oz can tomato sauce
1/2 cup water
2 tbsp. sugar
1 1/2 tsps. dried basil
1/2 tsp. fennel seed
1 tsp. Italian seasoning
1/2 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper

DIRECTIONS

1. In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the sausage, beef, onion and garlic until well browned.  Drain fat.  Put rest of ingredients in slow cooker (sauces and spices) and add meat mixture after it has been drained.   Let simmer a few hours and add red wine to thin out the sauce.

NOTES

This is very tomato-ey.  Try adding a bit more water or some red wine to thin it out a bit more.
