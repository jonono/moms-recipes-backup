Brie Twice-Baked Potatoes

INGREDIENTS

4 med. hot, baked Idaho or Russet Potatoes
4 Tbsp. butter at room temperature
2 Tbsp. heavy cream
3/4 tsp. kosher salt
1/4 tsp. pepper
1/8 tsp. nutmeg
2 oz Brie, cut into 1" cubes, at room temp
2 strips bacon, cooked until crisp and crumbled
3 Tbsp. minced chives

DIRECTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Line a shallow baking pan with foil
2. Slice off the top third of each potato lengthwise.  Carefully scoop out the flesh into a bowl, leaving a 1/2" thick shell.  Scoop out any potato flesh from the tops also and discard the skin.
3. Add butter, cream, salt, pepper and nutmeg and mash until combined.  Fold in Brie, bacon and chives.  
4. Mound the mashed potatoes into the shells and place in prepared pan.  (You can prepare ahead of time up to this point but let come to room temperature before finishing in oven).
5. Bake in 425 oven 15 to 30 minutes until cheese melts and stuffing is heated through.  Brown under broiler until golden if you like.
