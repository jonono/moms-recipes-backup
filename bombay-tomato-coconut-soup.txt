Bombay Tomato Coconut Soup

INGREDIENTS

1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup olive oil
1 28oz can crushed tomatoes
24 oz. water
1 bay leaf
2 tsp. oregano
pinch of cinnamon
1 12oz can coconut milk
1/4 cup toasted flaked coconut
salt and pepper to taste

DIRECTIONS

1. Heat olive oil to soup pot and heat until hot.  Add onion and celery and saute until tender, about 10 minutes.  Add the canned tomatoes, water, bay leaf, oregano and cinnamon and bring to boil.  Simmer 5 minutes and stir occasionally.  Stir in coconut milk and remove the bay leaf. 
2. In a blender, working in 2 cup batches, puree the soup.  Hold a towel over lid of blender so it won't blow open.  Place soup back in pot and season with salt and pepper.  Garnish with a sprinkle of toasted coconut.
3. To toast the coconut, spread the flaked coconut evenly on a cookie sheet and place on middle rack of oven for 3 to 5 minutes at 350.  Watch closely as it can burn easily.
