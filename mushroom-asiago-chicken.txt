Yield: 4 servings

INGREDIENTS

1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts
salt and pepper
1/2 cup flour
4 tbsp. butter
1 lb. sliced mushrooms
1/2 tsp. salt
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
3/4 cup chicken broth
3 sprigs fresh thyme or 3/4 tsp. dried thyme leaves
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup shredded Asiago cheese
Parmesan cheese for sprinkling

DIRECTIONS

1. Cut each chicken breasts into thirds and place between waxed paper.  Pound with a skillet or rolling pin to produce cutlets about 1/4" thick.  Season with salt and pepper and dredge with flour.  
2. In large skillet, melt about 2 tbsp. butter and saute cutlets for about 5 minutes on first side and then an additional minute on flip side until golden brown.  Remove cutlets to a plate and cover with foil and cook rest of cutlets with overcrowding pan.
3. After chicken in cooked, melt remaining butter in pan and add mushrooms with 1/2 tsp. salt.  Cook about 10 minutes until golden brown and softened.  Add garlic and cook another 2 minutes.
4. Pour white wine into skillet and scrape up anything sticking to pan.  Once the wine has nearly all evaporated, add 3/4 cup chicken broth and thyme.  Bring to boil, reduce heat and cook for 10-15 minutes at a rapid simmer until liquid is reduced by half.  Be patient with this step.
5. Reduce heat to med low and stir in heavy cream.  Sprinkle the Asiago cheese over the top of the sauce and stir constantly until cheese melts.  Nestle the chicken back into skillet and allow it to simmer in the sauce until chicken is heated through and sauce has slightly thickened.  Sprinkle with a bit of Parmesan and serve right away either by itself or spooned over mashed potatoes.
