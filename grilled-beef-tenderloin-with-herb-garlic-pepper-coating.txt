feeds about a dozen people

INGREDIENTS

1 - 5 pound whole beef tenderloin
6 Tbsp. olive oil
8 large garlic cloves, minced
2 Tbsp. minced fresh rosemary
1 Tbsp. dried thyme leaves
2 Tbsp. ground black pepper
1 Tbsp. salt

DIRECTIONS

1. Prepare beef:  Trim off excess fat with a sharp knife.  Fold thin tip under the approximate the thickness of the rest of the roast.   Tie with butcher's twine, then keep tying the roast with the twine every couple of inches to help roast keep its shape.  Snip silverskin with scissors to keep roast from bowing during cooking.  Then, mix ingredients and rub over roast to coat.  Set meat aside.  You can do this early in day, cover with saran wrap and take out an hour before grilling.
2. Turn gas BBQ on high for 10 minutes.  Lubricate grate with oil soaked rag using tongs.  Place beef on hot rack and close lid.  Grill until well seared about 5 minutes.  Turn meat and close lid.  Grill until well seared on second side another 5 minutes.
3. Move meat to grill's cool side.  Cook until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part registers 130 degrees for rosy pink, 45 to 60 minutes depending on size and grill.  Let meat rest 15 minutes before carving.
