DIRECTIONS

1. Beat eggs, oil, buttermilk and sugar until blended.  Add flour, soda, cinnamon and salt.  Mix in pineapple, carrots, nuts and coconut.  Pour into greased 13 x 9 baking dish.  Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.
2. Bring glaze ingredients to boil and simmer 5 minutes.  Remove cake from oven and slowly pout hot glaze over cake separating side away from the pan to allow glaze more room.  Let cool. I only use half the ingredients at times.
3. 3.Can make 24 muffins instead without the glaze.  Bake 25 minutes.
